# Forter Challenge: Chat Bot With an Attitude

## Getting started

The front-end is built with Dojo Starter Kit. The back-end is built with Node.js and Express (In real life with some more time Ill probably separate the two to different repos and built the BE with Nest.js, prisma and typescript).
The database is just a plain JSON file to mimic NoSQL, Since there is no live demo
it was important to me that anyone could just `run npm start` and see the final app _working locally_.

### Start the development server

    npm i && npm start

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8000` adn the API at `http://localhost:8999`

## Task

Implement a chat application where each user can post questions & answers in a chat room. We would also want for you to feature one special member to that room - an awesome bot which should answer questions that were already answered before.
